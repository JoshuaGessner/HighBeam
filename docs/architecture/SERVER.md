## Overview

The HighBeam server is a standalone Rust binary that manages multiplayer sessions for BeamNG.drive. It accepts connections from HighBeam client mods, relays vehicle state between players, and runs server-side Lua plugins.

### Platform Support

The server targets **Windows**, **Linux**, and **macOS**:

| Platform | Arch | Use Case | GUI | Headless |
|----------|------|----------|-----|----------|
| Windows x86_64 | x64 | Personal hosting, development | Yes | Yes |
| Linux x86_64 | x64 | Dedicated servers, VPS/cloud | Yes | Yes (primary) |
| Linux aarch64 | ARM64 | ARM cloud instances (AWS Graviton, etc.) | Yes | Yes |
| macOS x86_64 | x64 | Development | Yes | Yes |
| macOS aarch64 | ARM64 | Development (Apple Silicon) | Yes | Yes |

All platform-specific behavior is handled by Rust's standard library and the `tokio` async runtime. No `#[cfg(target_os)]` conditional compilation is required for the networking or session management layers.

## Module Design

### Network Layer (`net/`)

#### TCP (`tcp.rs`)
- Listens on configured port (default `18860`)
- Spawns a task per client connection
- Handles the handshake and authentication exchange
- Receives reliable packets (chat, vehicle spawn/edit/delete, plugin events)
- Sends reliable packets to clients
- Integrates plugin hooks for auth, vehicle spawn, chat, and custom events

#### UDP (`udp.rs`)
- Single UDP socket bound to the same port
- Receives position updates from all clients
- Routes position updates to other connected clients
- Authenticates UDP packets via session token prefix

#### Packet (`packet.rs`)
- Defines packet types as Rust enums
- Serialization: Rust struct → binary wire format
- Deserialization: binary wire format → Rust struct
- Version field in every packet for forward compatibility

### Session Layer (`session/`)

#### Session Manager (`manager.rs`)
- Creates sessions on successful auth
- Issues cryptographically random session tokens (64-byte entropy + timestamp)
- Maps session tokens → player IDs
- Maps truncated SHA-256 session hashes → player IDs (for UDP auth)
- Handles disconnect cleanup (remove vehicles, notify other players)
- Enforces max players limit
- Provides `broadcast()` and `send_to_player()` methods for packet delivery

#### Rate Limiter (`rate_limiter.rs`)
- Token-bucket rate limiting per IP (auth) and per player (chat, spawn)
- Configurable windows: auth 5/60s, chat 10/10s, spawn 5/5s

#### Authentication
- **No external auth service.** All auth is handled inline in `tcp.rs`.
- Supports multiple auth modes (configured in `ServerConfig.toml`):

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `open` | Anyone can join, no credentials required |
| `password` | Server-wide password required to connect |
| `allowlist` | Only pre-approved usernames/tokens can connect |

- Passwords are never stored in plaintext — Argon2 hashed
- Rate limiting on failed auth attempts (configurable)

#### Player (`player.rs`)
- Struct holding all per-player state:
  - Player ID (server-assigned integer)
  - Display name
  - Session token
  - Session hash (truncated SHA-256 for UDP auth)
  - TCP sender channel handle
  - UDP address (registered after auth)
  - Connection timestamp
  - Last activity timestamp
  - Last pong time (heartbeat tracking)

### State Layer (`state/`)

#### Vehicle (`vehicle.rs`)
- Struct per vehicle:
  - Vehicle ID (server-assigned)
  - Owner player ID
  - Configuration (JSON blob — parts, paint, tuning)
  - Last known position, rotation, velocity
  - Last update timestamp

#### World (`world.rs`)
- Concurrent map of all players and their vehicles (using DashMap)
- Vehicle spawn, edit, delete, reset tracking
- Vehicle count per player (for MaxCarsPerPlayer enforcement)
- Ownership validation (`is_owner()`)
- Query methods for plugins: `get_vehicle_snapshot()`, `vehicle_count_for_player()`
- Broadcasts: handled by SessionManager, not World directly

### Plugin Runtime (`plugin/`)

#### Runtime (`runtime.rs`)
- Each plugin gets its own Lua 5.4 state (isolation via `mlua`)
- Plugins loaded from `Resources/Server/<PluginName>/main.lua`
- Load order determined by alphabetical directory sort
- Only safe Lua stdlib exposed: `table`, `string`, `math`, `utf8`, `coroutine` (no OS/IO/debug/package)
- Hot reload: polls directory every 2s using file hash change detection, reloads all plugin states on change
- Console eval: `lua <plugin_name> <code>` from server stdin for runtime inspection
- Event dispatch: iterates loaded plugins in order, supports cancellation

#### API (`api.rs`)
- Exposes `HB.*` namespace to Lua (analogous to BeamMP's `MP.*`)
- API functions currently implemented:

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `HB.Player.GetPlayers()` | Returns table of all connected players `{id, name}` |
| `HB.Player.DropPlayer(pid, reason?)` | Kick a player (sends Kick packet) |
| `HB.Chat.SendChatMessage(text)` | Broadcast a chat message as "Server" |
| `HB.Vehicle.GetVehicles()` | Returns table of all vehicles `{player_id, vehicle_id, data}` |
| `HB.Vehicle.DeleteVehicle(pid, vid)` | Force-remove a vehicle (validates ownership) |
| `HB.Event.SendServerMessage(text)` | Broadcast a server announcement |
| `HB.Event.TriggerClientEvent(pid, name, payload?)` | Send custom event to a specific client |
| `HB.Event.BroadcastClientEvent(name, payload?)` | Send custom event to all clients |
| `HB.Util.Log(level, message)` | Structured logging (trace/debug/info/warn/error) |
| `HB.Util.RandomInt(min, max)` | Generate random integer in range |
| `HB.FS.ReadFile(path)` | Read file relative to plugin dir (traversal-protected, max 50 MB per read — v0.9.0) |
| `HB.FS.WriteFile(path, contents)` | Write file relative to plugin dir (traversal-protected, max 10 MB per write, 100 MB per-plugin quota — v0.9.0) |
| `HB.FS.Exists(path)` | Check file existence relative to plugin dir |

#### Events (`events.rs`)
- Built-in events matching game lifecycle:

| Event | Context Fields | Cancellable |
|-------|---------------|-------------|
| `OnPlayerAuth` | `username`, `addr` | Yes |
| `OnVehicleSpawn` | `player_id`, `data` | Yes |
| `OnChatMessage` | `player_id`, `text` | Yes |
| `OnClientEvent` | `player_id`, `name`, `payload` | Yes |

- Cancellation contract: handlers return `false`, a reason string, or `{ cancel = true, reason = "..." }` to block the action
- Plugin errors are isolated — one plugin crash is logged but doesn't affect others

## Configuration

### ServerConfig.toml

```toml
[General]
Name = "My HighBeam Server"
Port = 18860
MaxPlayers = 20
MaxCarsPerPlayer = 3
Map = "/levels/gridmap_v2/info.json"
Description = "A HighBeam server"
ResourceFolder = "Resources"

[Auth]
Mode = "open"              # "open", "password", or "allowlist"
# Password = ""            # Required if Mode = "password"
# Allowlist = ["Player1"]  # Required if Mode = "allowlist"
MaxAuthAttempts = 5        # Per IP, before temporary block
AuthTimeoutSec = 30        # Time limit for auth handshake

[Network]
TickRate = 20              # Server tick rate (Hz)
UdpBufferSize = 65535      # UDP receive buffer size
TcpKeepAliveSec = 15       # TCP keepalive interval
# ModSyncPort = 18861      # Optional separate port for launcher mod transfers (defaults to Port+1)

[Logging]
Level = "info"             # "debug", "info", "warn", "error"
LogFile = "server.log"
LogChat = true

[Security]
AllowPluginEval = false    # Allow `lua <plugin> <code>` console command (v0.9.0)
PluginStorageQuotaMB = 100 # Per-plugin storage quota in megabytes (v0.9.0)
PluginMaxFileSizeMB = 10   # Maximum single plugin file size in megabytes (v0.9.0)
MaxEventPayloadKB = 64     # Maximum event payload size in kilobytes (v0.9.0)
```

---

## Build & Run

```bash
# Development
cd server
cargo build

# Release
cargo build --release

# Run
./target/release/highbeam-server
# or with custom config:
./target/release/highbeam-server --config /path/to/ServerConfig.toml
```

---

## Resource Directory

```
Resources/
├── Client/
│   └── (mod .zip files served to connecting launchers)
└── Server/
    ├── MyPlugin/
    │   └── main.lua           # Plugin entry point (required)
    └── AnotherPlugin/
        ├── main.lua
        └── data/
            └── config.json    # Plugin data files (accessible via HB.FS.*)
```

Plugins are loaded alphabetically by directory name. Each plugin must have a `main.lua` entry point. The `HB.*` API namespace is available in all plugin scripts.

---

## Community Relay (Optional Server Listing)

Servers can optionally register with a community-run relay so players can discover them from the in-game **Browse Servers** tab. This is entirely opt-in and requires no central HighBeam service.

Enable it in `ServerConfig.toml`:

```toml
[Discovery]
EnableRelay             = true
RelayUrls               = ["http://relay.example.com"]
RegistrationIntervalSec = 30
```

The server sends a periodic HTTP POST heartbeat to each relay URL containing the server's name, map, player count, and port. Players browse the relay from the in-game browser or via `highbeam-launcher --browse-relay <url>`.

See [RELAY.md](RELAY.md) for the full relay architecture, JSON API contract, and an example relay implementation.

## Security Protocol

> **Security is non-negotiable. Every layer of the server must enforce strict security practices.**

### Principles

1. **Never trust client input.** All data from clients is untrusted. Validate packet sizes, field ranges, string lengths, and JSON structure before processing. Reject malformed data immediately.
2. **Authenticate everything.** TCP packets are only processed from authenticated sessions. UDP packets are validated against session token hashes — unknown hashes are silently dropped.
3. **Rate limit aggressively.** Auth attempts, chat messages, vehicle spawns, and plugin events all have configurable rate limits. Exceeding limits results in temporary bans or disconnects.
4. **Isolate plugin execution.** Each Lua plugin runs in its own sandboxed state. Plugins cannot access the filesystem outside their own directory without explicit `FS.*` API calls. No `os.execute`, `io.popen`, or raw FFI access in plugin Lua states. FS operations are subject to per-plugin storage quotas (100 MB), file size limits (10 MB write / 50 MB read), and file count caps (1,000 per plugin). See v0.9.0 milestone.
5. **Hash and salt credentials.** Server passwords are Argon2-hashed on disk. Session tokens are cryptographically random and short-lived.
6. **Enforce resource limits.** MaxPlayers, MaxCarsPerPlayer, max packet size (1MB), per-player bandwidth caps, and event payload limits (64 KB) prevent resource exhaustion.
7. **Graceful error handling.** Invalid packets, malformed JSON, and unexpected disconnects must never crash the server. All error paths log structured warnings and clean up state.
8. **Minimize attack surface.** The server exposes only port 18860 (TCP + UDP). No HTTP endpoints, no admin panels over the network. The GUI is local-only (rendered via egui, not a web server).
9. **Sign mod manifests.** The server signs the mod manifest with an Ed25519 key so launchers can verify mod integrity. See v0.9.0 milestone.
10. **Restrict console eval.** `AllowPluginEval` defaults to `false` in production to prevent arbitrary code injection into plugin Lua states via console. See v0.9.0 milestone.
